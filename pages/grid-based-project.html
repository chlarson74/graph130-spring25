            <h1>Grid Based Layout</h1>
            <p>Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well. The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas. <a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples" target="_blank">eleken.co</a></p>

                <h2>ON LEAVING BALTIMORE</h2>
                <p><i>Duane Niaturn</i></p>

                <p>A falling star heaves the word against the wall.<br>
                Dodging this way, then that, I hope<br>
                The wind stays lost in history. <br>
                That damn owl. For years I' ve been waiting<br>
                For it to speak up, announce the dream is a fraud,<br>
                Send the insomniac back to the bed<br>
                That haunts him like a bat.</p>

                <h2>COLD POEM</h2>
                <p><i>Fredrick Morgue</i></p>

                <p>Sparks flying everywhere: if one should kindle<br>
                all might be burned in the glad destruction<br>
                and the old wager won.</p>

                <h2>NORTH LIGHT</h2>
                <p><i>Stuart Seersars</i></p>

                <p>The sun dials itself to Low at four these wintry days.<br>
                Can't paint without light.<br>
                Up on the point, water's slow,<br>
                or seems slow, slower,<br>
                seems to come off the rocks with an effort, ebbing away.<br>
